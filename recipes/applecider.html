    <h1>Apple Cider</h1>
    <img src="../images/applecider.jpg" alt="Apple Cider">
    <p>This delicious homemade apple cider recipe is super-easy to 
        make in the Crock-Pot, Instant Pot or on the stovetop. It's 
        made simply with apples, warming spices, water, and your 
        choice of sweetener. And it is so comforting and delicious.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>10-12 medium apples (assorted types), quartered</li>
        <li>2 oranges, quartered (also peeled, if you would 
            like your cider less tart)</li>
        <li>4 cinnamon sticks</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon whole cloves</li>
        <li>16 cups water</li>
        <li>1/2 cup sweetener (I recommend brown sugar or maple syrup)</li>
        <li><em>optional extra seasonings</em>: 1 teaspoon whole allspice, 
            1 whole nutmeg, and/or 1 inch fresh ginger</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Combine</strong> your ingredients in a stockpot.  Add the apples, 
            oranges, cinnamon, cloves and (optional) extra seasonings to 
            a large stockpot.  Cover with water, leaving about an inch 
            or two of space at the top of the stockpot.</li>
        <li><strong>Simmer.</strong>  Heat the cider over high heat until it reaches a 
            simmer.  Then reduce heat to medium-low, cover and simmer 
            for about 2 hours, or until the apples are completely soft.</li>
        <li><strong>Mash the apples and oranges.</strong> Using a potato masher or a wooden 
            spoon, take a minute to mash all of the apples and oranges 
            against the side of the stockpot to release more of their 
            flavors.  Then cover and simmer for 1 more hour.</li>
        <li><strong>Strain.</strong> Using a fine-mesh strainer or a 
            cheesecloth, strain out all of the solids (apples, oranges, 
            spices), pressing them against the strainer to release all 
            of their juices.  Discard the solids.</li>
        <li><strong>Sweeten.</strong> Stir in your desired amount of 
            sweetener, to taste.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve warm.</strong> Then, your cider is all ready to 
            go!  For extra presentation points, I like to add a few fresh 
            orange slices and cinnamon sticks back to the stockpot for 
            pretty serving.  But however you like to serve it, your cider 
            is now ready to go and enjoy. Or feel free to let the cider 
            cool to room temperature, then transfer to a sealed pitcher 
            and refrigerate for up to 5 days.  Or freeze for up to 3 
            months.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <p>Peeling the oranges first will reduce the tartness of the cider, 
        if you would like.</p>
