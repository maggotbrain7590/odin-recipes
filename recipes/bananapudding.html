        <p>
            This dairy-free banana pudding features bananas IN the pudding 
            itself for a luscious and boldly-flavored dessert. Layer with 
            wafers and banana slices or enjoy as-is! 
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>⅓ cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 ⅔ cup coconut milk (one can)</li>
            <li>1 cup almond milk, vanilla or plain</li>
            <li>2 large ripe bananas</li>
            <li>Squeeze of lemon juice</li>
            <li>4 large egg yolks</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>2 tablespoon coconut oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk together sugar, cornstarch, and salt in a medium saucepan. 
                Pour in coconut and almond milks and stir together. Set saucepan 
                on the stove over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Add bananas to a food processor and pulse until smooth and creamy. 
                Add a squeeze of lemon juice and stir in. Pour into the saucepan and stir.</li>
            <li>Whisk together egg yolks in a bowl and slowly pour into the saucepan, 
                whisking continuously.</li>
            <li>Continue to stir frequently as the pudding mixture heats for 10-15 
                minutes, or until the consistency is thick enough to coat the back 
                of a wooden spoon.</li>
            <li>Remove saucepan from heat and stir in vanilla extract and coconut oil. 
                Once all combined evenly, press a piece of plastic wrap against the 
                surface of the pudding (this prevents a film from forming) and let sit 
                at room temperature to cool for about 30 minutes. Then transfer to the 
                refrigerator to chill completely.</li>
            <li>To assemble, line bottom and sides of serving dish with vanilla wafers. 
                Add a layer of pudding, and then top with a layer of banana slices.</li>
            <li>Add another layer of pudding over the banana slices, and then add another 
                layer of vanilla wafers. Line up vanilla wafers along the sides again at 
                this point.</li>
            <li>Top with another layer of pudding, and then decorate with banana slices 
                and crushed vanilla wafers.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Notes</h3>
        <p>Dairy-free note: Beyond not using dairy milk and butter, be sure to check the 
            nutrition label for your particular vanilla wafers to ensure they do not 
            contain dairy. While the classic Nabisco brand contains milk, I have found 
            dairy-free brands available in supermarkets (Sprouts, Whole Foods, Walmart) 
            and online (Amazon, Vitacost).</p>
        <p>The quantity of vanilla wafers will vary depending on how you'd like to assemble 
            this banana pudding. For all you see in these pictures, I used a little more 
            than half of one regular-sized box.</p>
            <p>The pudding can be made the day before assembling. Refrigerate with the plastic 
                wrap pressed against the surface.</p>
