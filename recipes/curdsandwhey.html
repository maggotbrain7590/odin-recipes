        <p>A classic take on a classic recipe. Lil Miss Moffet would 
            be proud!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups of milk</li>
            <li>4 teaspoons vinegar</li>
            <li><em>You can also use 4 teaspoons of lemon juice, or as a 
                nice alternative, orange juice, which will make a 
                slightly sweeter curd for use in home made cheesecakes. 
                If the curds don't seem to be forming, add an extra 
                teaspoon or two of your chosen citrus juice.</em></li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place two cups of milk in the saucepan. Slowly bring the 
                milk to the boil, while stirring constantly. It is very 
                important to constantly stir the milk or it will burn.</li>
            <li> Turn off the heat once the milk is boiling. Leave the 
                saucepan on the heat source to cool slowly.</li>
            <li>Add 4 teaspoons of vinegar or citrus fruit juice to the 
                boiling milk. At this point, the milk should curdle and 
                turn into curds and whey. Scoop out the curds and store 
                separately. Use as required.</li>
